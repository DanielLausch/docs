 - The file must be located under the proper folder, using the category in the [App Store](https://akaunting.com/apps) like **{category}/{slug}.md**. For example, *ecommerce/woocommerce.md*

 - The link added to the **MENU.md** must be like **app-manual/{category}/{slug}**. For example, *app-manual/ecommerce/woocommerce*

 - The link added to the **MENU.md** must be in alphabetic order.
